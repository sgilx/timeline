                    <h4>1899</h4>
                    <p>Chattanoga, Tennessee. The start of the icon we know now as Coca-Cola&trade;.
                        Joseph Whitehead and Benjamin Thomas negotiated the rights to the bottle in Atlanta, GA
                        as it was previously only available from fountains. Their efforts proved successful, allowing
                        consumers to purchase the long glass bottle with a metal stopper in stores.

                    <h4>1906</h4>
                    <p>The Amber Bottle. This was the first bottle with the proper Coca-Cola&trade; logo
                        on it; embossed and with a diamond label. However, it was also during this time that the company came across knock-offs
                        and imitator brands such as: 'Noka-Cola', 'Ma Coca-Co', etc.

                    <h4>1915</h4>
                    <p>The First Contour bottle. Due to issues with competitors, Coca-Cola&trade;
                        decided it's distinct logo was not enough and created the Contour bottle 
                        for 'distinct' packaging. Many glass companies were competing to create this distinct bottle.
                        Ultimately, the Root Glass company 'won'. <br>Fun Fact: each bottle weighed more than 1 lb including the drink itself.

                    <p>The New Contour. Some alterations were made to the bottle shape that originally won.
                        This one was approved for production, creating the iconic bottle we all know now.

                    <h4>1957</h4>
                    <p>The White Label. Stepping away from embossed logos, Coca-Cola took a step into the future.
                        They instead began to print their logo onto the bottle in white color with their unique franchise font.

                    <h4>1961</h4>
                    <p>Wrap Label. With innovations in the ACL(Applied Color Labeling), the company was able to create
                        a fully wrapped label for their bottles. In this design, they added the red background which became 
                        a large part of their iconic logo. In 1971, the contour bottle became only the second packaging design in history
                        to be granted a registeredd trademark (&trade;).

                    <h4>1978 / 1993</h4>
                    <p>Plastic > Glass. With the fragility of glass bottles, the introduction of the plastic bottle was revolutionary.
                        Not only was it more durable, it was resealable, and recyclable. Beginning in 1978, the 2 liter bottle was introduced, followed
                        by the smaller 20oz bottle in 1993.

                    <p>Aluminum. Coca-Cola&trade; selectively introduced the aluminum bottle. This was part of 
                        the Magnificent Five series. This limited-edition series were known for being much lighter and
                        exclusive branding. In 2008, this bottle won the Design Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions festival.

                    <p>Coca-Cola. At 110, Coca-Cola's legacy and impact is undeniable. Glass, plastic, aluminum, any form of bottle
                        is well recognized. It is only a matter of time until Coca-Cola's next innovation.
